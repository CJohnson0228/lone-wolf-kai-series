      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>Before leaving the northern port of Anskaven, you are escorted to the City Hall and equipped with special winter boots, a tunic, a fur-lined cloak, and mittens. You are given a <a href="map.htm">Map of Kalte</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the &lsquo;Gold Crowns&rsquo; section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry fifty Crowns.)</p>
      <p>Before you set sail, you are given the choice of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take any two of the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Sword (Weapons)<br/>
        <br/>

       <li>Short Sword (Weapons)<br/>

         </a>
        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Padded Leather Waistcoat (Special Items). This adds 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total.<br/>
        <br/>
        <figure>

         </a>
        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Items). This restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is only enough for one dose.<br/>

        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Special Rations (Meals). This counts as one meal. (See &lsquo;How to Use Your Equipment&rsquo; before deciding.)<br/>

      <p>List the two items you choose on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points or <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p>

      <p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You don&rsquo;t need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Sword&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Short Sword&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Padded Leather Waistcoat&mdash;worn on the body.</li>
       <li>Spear&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Mace&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Warhammer&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Axe&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Potion of Laumspur&mdash;carried in the Backpack.</li>

      </ul>
      <h4>
       <a id="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a>
      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
      <h4>
       <a id="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a>
      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry eight items in your Backpack at once.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>The currency of Sommerlund is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Gold is especially valuable in Kalte, and you may find that your Gold Crowns will be useful, especially if used as a bribe.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>Stored on your ice-sledge, along with your tent and other equipment, is enough food for you to complete your mission. If this food, or any you may have in your Backpack, is unavailable to you when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. As Kalte is an icy desert you will be unable to use the Kai Discipline of Hunting to obtain a Meal (see &lsquo;Hunting&rsquo; in the <a href="discplnz.htm">Kai Disciplines</a> section).<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
       <dd>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points immediately prior to a combat. There is only enough for one dose. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of their effect. All potions are Backpack Items.<br/>
