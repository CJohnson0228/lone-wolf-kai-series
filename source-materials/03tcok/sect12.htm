      <h3>12</h3>
      <p>The equipment is quickly unpacked and distributed among you. Your share is enough food for 3 Meals, Sleeping Furs, and a Rope. Remember to mark these on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, and note that Sleeping Furs take up the same amount of room as two normal items in your Backpack.</p>
      <p>You cannot take the Kanu-dogs with you across the mountains, and you are forced to abandon them here with the sledges. A rope is secured to each person and you set off towards a narrow pass between the dark and sullen peaks. At first, the climb is quite easy; but soon the smooth ice becomes steep and difficult to cross. A wind rises that piles drifts of loose snow against the broken ice, and visibility is quickly reduced to a few yards. The drifts are deceptive and often deep. On two occasions, you sink up to your chest and have to be dug out by the others.</p>
      <p>That night, the tent is erected on a table of ice-covered granite overhanging a deep ravine. You are exhausted and almost fall asleep over your evening Meal. (Remember to deduct this Meal from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Do you understand any of the Ice Barbarian language?&rsquo; asks Dyce, trying to stimulate conversation. &lsquo;Myjavik is one of the few Ice Barbarian words I know.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>When you ask him what it means, he pauses before answering you. &lsquo;Terror&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;&ldquo;Myjavik&rdquo; means terror.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>Suddenly there is a tremendous noise outside the tent. It sounds like the roar of a large animal.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you wish to draw your weapon and investigate the noise, <a href="sect180.htm">turn to 180</a>.</p>
      <p class="choice">If you prefer to hold your breath and keep as still as possible, <a href="sect259.htm">turn to 259</a>.</p>
