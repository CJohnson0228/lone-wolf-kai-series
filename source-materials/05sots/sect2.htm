      <h3>2</h3>
      <p>Breathless from the exertion of combat, you step back as the Elix finally collapses and dies. Slowly, its glass-green eyes mist over and become opaque like hard, cold jadin. Around the creature&rsquo;s blood-spattered throat hangs a Gold Key on a chain. You quickly discover that the Gold Key opens the steel door of a strongroom at the far end of apothecary.</p>
      <p>High upon a shelf, just inside the door, you find a small box that contains what you seek&mdash;the Oede herb. Within seconds of pressing the beautiful golden leaves to your wounded shoulder, a tingling sensation engulfs your whole arm. The numbness soon fades, and both your arm and shoulder are free of the horrific Limbdeath microbes.</p>
      <p>Sufficient Oede herb remains in the box for one further application. It is a powerful substance that can be used against many deadly diseases or alternatively can be used to restore 10 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points if swallowed after combat. If you wish to keep the Oede herb, mark it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item. You should also restore the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> points that were temporarily lost due to Limbdeath.</p>
      <p>After dragging the dead Elix into the strongroom, you lock the steel door from the inside. You notice that there are in fact two doors to the strongroom: the one by which you entered and a smaller door set into the opposite wall. The Gold Key opens the lock of the new door, which leads to a narrow staircase beyond, dimly lit by flaring torches in wall brackets.</p>
      <p>The climb is steep and arduous. You suspect that these steps are part of a secret route to the strongroom, and your suspicions are only confirmed when you arrive at what appears to be a dead end. A closer examination reveals a narrow bronze door set flush to the wall, plain in appearance except for a tiny key hole close to the floor. As you insert and twist the Gold Key, you are quietly confident that the bronze door will open.</p>
