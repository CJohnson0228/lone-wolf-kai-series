      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>You are dressed in the green tunic and cloak of a Kai initiate. You have little with you to arm yourself for survival.</p>
      <p>All you possess is an Axe (note under Weapons on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) and a Backpack containing 1 Meal (note under Meals on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>). Hanging from your waist is a leather pouch containing Gold Crowns. To find out how many, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. This number equals the number of Gold Crowns you possess at the start of the adventure. (Note the number in the Belt Pouch section of the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
      <p>You discover amongst the smoking ruins of the monastery, a <a href="map.htm">Map of Sommerlund</a> (note under Special Items on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>) showing the capital city of Holmgard and the land of Durenor, far to the east. You place the <a href="map.htm">Map</a> inside your tunic for safety.</p>
      <p>You also find one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>1 = Sword (Weapons)<br/>

       <li>2 = Helmet (Special Items). This adds 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total.<br/>

      <p>To discover which of the above you find, you must pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> and find the corresponding article on the list. Note this on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p>
      <h4>
       <a id="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a>
      </h4>
      <p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it is carried. You don&rsquo;t need to make notes but you can refer back to this list in the course of your adventure.</p>
      <ul>
       <li>1 = Sword&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>2 = Helmet&mdash;worn on the head.</li>
       <li>3 = Food&mdash;placed in the Backpack.</li>
       <li>4 = Chainmail Waistcoat&mdash;worn on the body.</li>
       <li>5 = Mace&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>6 = Healing Potion&mdash;carried in the Backpack.</li>
       <li>7 = Quarterstaff&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>8 = Spear&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>9 = Gold Crowns&mdash;carried in the Belt Pouch.</li>
       <li>0 = Broadsword&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
       <a id="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a>
      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
      <h4>
       <a id="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a>
      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.</dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry eight items in your Backpack at once.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.</dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>The local currency is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Gold Crowns can be used on your adventure to pay for transport, food, or even as a bribe! Many of the creatures that you will encounter possess Gold Crowns, or have them hidden in their lairs. Whenever you kill a creature, you may take any Gold Crowns that it has and put them in your Belt Pouch.</dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your five skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</dd>
       <dt>Healing Potion</dt>
       <dd>This can restore 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points immediately prior to a combat. There is only enough for one dose. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be told then of their effect. All Healing Potions are Backpack Items.</dd>
