      <h3>116</h3>
      <p>&lsquo;I was hoping the King would send a large search party,&rsquo; says Captain D&rsquo;Val wryly, now having fully recovered from his exhaustion. &lsquo;I was beginning to tire of this town.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You rise from your straw bed and offer your thanks to the captain. His brave and timely action saved you from certain death. &lsquo;&thinsp;&rsquo;Tis nothing to compare with you, Lone Wolf. Your bravery is legend. Your presence here is worth a hundred men.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>He asks you about your mission, and you recount the events that have led you to this meeting; the ride south, the loss of your company, your passage through the Maaken Mines and the bandits.</p>
      <p>&lsquo;Yes, the bandits&mdash;Barraka&rsquo;s men,&rsquo; retorts D&rsquo;Val, his gruff voice conveying his contempt for them and their leader. &lsquo;It seems we have both suffered at his hand. A month ago, he and his Vassagonian renegades ambushed my troop on the Ruanon Pike. We were sorely outnumbered and the fight was indeed bitter. But we broke free from them and escaped here to Ruanon. We have been beleaguered ever since and praying for help to arrive. We have enough weapons to resist them, but we have barely enough food and water to survive.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>You ask what has become of the people of Ruanon. &lsquo;Most are now slaves. Barraka has taken the mines and he uses the Ruanese as forced labour. Other than yourself, only one man has escaped from the mines and survived the Warhounds and the bandit snipers. That man is Baron Oren Vanalund. Come, I shall take you to him.&rsquo;</p>
      <p>D&rsquo;Val leads you to the topmost chamber of the watchtower and pushes open an iron-shod door. The sight that greets you fills your heart with sorrow and pity.</p>
