      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>Before leaving Holmgard on your ride south, you are given a <a href="map.htm">Map of the Southlands</a>, a Badge of Rank that you wear upon the sleeve of your tunic, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may now enter this number in the &lsquo;Gold Crowns&rsquo; section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (If you have successfully completed previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess. Remember you can only carry a maximum of fifty Crowns.)</p>
      <p>You may take your pick of the following items (in addition to those you already possess, but remember you may only carry two weapons). You may take up to six of the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Warhammer (Weapons)<br/>
        <br/>

        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Dagger (Weapons)<br/>

          <img alt="illustration" class="img-responsive" src="dagger.png"/>
         </a>
        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>2 Potions of Laumspur (Backpack Items). Each of these potions restores 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total when swallowed after combat. Each potion contains enough for one dose.<br/>
        <br/>

         </a>
        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>5 Special Rations (Meals). Each of these Special Rations counts as one Meal, and each takes up one space in your Backpack.<br/>

         </a>

       </li>
       <li>Chainmail Waistcoat (Special Items). This adds 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total.<br/>
        <br/>

         </a>
        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Shield (Special Items) This adds 2 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> when used in combat.<br/>
        <br/>
        <figure>
         <a href="shield.png">

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>List the six items that you choose on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points or <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p>

       <li>Warhammer&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>
       <li>Dagger&mdash;carried in the hand.</li>

      <h4>
       <a id="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a>
      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty Crowns.</dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
      <h4>
       <a id="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a>
      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.</dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry a maximum of eight items in your Backpack at any time.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.</dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>The currency of Sommerlund is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Whenever you kill an enemy and search the body, you may take any Gold Crowns that you find and put them in your Belt Pouch.</dd>
       <dt>
        <a id="food">Food</a>
       </dt>
       <dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat (unless you are in an area of wilderness where the opportunity for hunting is limited).</dd>
       <dt>Potions of Laumspur</dt>
       <dd>These are healing potions that can restore 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total when swallowed after combat. They cannot be used to increase <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for two doses only. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be informed of their effect. All potions are Backpack Items.</dd>
