      <h3>Rules for Combat</h3>
      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy&rsquo;s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf&rsquo;s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to zero while losing as few <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf&rsquo;s and the enemy&rsquo;s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> total.<br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>Subtract the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.<br/>
        <br/>Example<br/>
        <br/>Lone Wolf (<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>, giving a total <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 17.<br/>
        <br/>He subtracts the Winged Devil&rsquo;s <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of &minus;3. (17 &minus; 20 = &minus;3). &minus;3 is noted on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>Turn to the <a href="crtable.htm">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)<br/>
        <br/>Example<br/>
        <br/>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as 3. If the number taken from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br/>
        <br/>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points</li>
         <li>Winged Devil loses 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>On the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to the participants in the combat.<br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="cmbtrulz.htm#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points reduced.</p>
      <p>A <a href="crsumary.htm">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
      <h4>
       <a id="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a>
      </h4>
      <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
