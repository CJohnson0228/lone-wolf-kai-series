      <h3>20</h3>
      <p>An arrow hisses overhead; a scream of agony fills the air. The bow slips from the archer&rsquo;s fingers as he sinks to his knees, the arrow lodged deep between his startled eyes. The clack of fangs and the soft swift pad of stealthy feet tell you that the Warhounds are closing in. You look up to see a man running towards you from the barricade. He has a shield in one hand and a longbow in the other; it is Guard Captain D&rsquo;Val. He reaches you, breathless from his run, and draws an arrow from his quiver. D&rsquo;Val aims and fires, drawing another arrow from his quiver as soon as the first is loosed. The Warhounds tumble and crash to the ground around you, felled by D&rsquo;Val&rsquo;s deadly shafts. Eight lie dead before his quiver is empty.</p>

      <p>The captain grabs you by the arm and, swinging you over his shoulder in one swift motion, carries you back towards the barricade. Others run forward to help you, but the bandit archers are now in range and your men are forced back by a hail of arrows. The red shafts of the enemy whistle past on all sides. You reach the barricade, a wagon is pulled aside, and you are carried in through the gap. Captain D&rsquo;Val is close to exhaustion; he staggers, and his men rush to catch him before he drops to the ground.</p>
