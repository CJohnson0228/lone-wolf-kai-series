      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>Guard Captain D&rsquo;Val leads you to the Royal Armoury where your green tunic and Kai cloak are taken from you to be repaired and cleaned. While you await their return, Captain D&rsquo;Val hands you a pouch of Gold for your journey. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. Now add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you may enter this number in the &lsquo;Gold Crowns&rsquo; section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (If you successfully completed <a href="../../lw/01fftd/title.htm">Book 1</a>, you may add this sum to the total of any Crowns you may already possess.)</p>
      <p>On a large table in the centre of the armoury, a number of items have been laid out for your choice. You may take any two of the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Sword (Weapons)<br/>
        <br/>

       </li>
       <li>Short Sword (Weapons)<br/>

         </a>

       </li>
       <li>Two Meals (Meals)<br/>

         </a>
        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Chainmail Waistcoat (Special Items). This adds 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total.<br/>
        <br/>
        <figure>
         <a href="mail.png">

        </figure>
       </li>
       <li>Healing Potion (Backpack Item). This can restore 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total, when swallowed after combat. There is only enough for one dose.<br/>

       <li>Shield (Special Items) This adds 2 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> when used in combat.<br/>
        <br/>
        <figure>
         <a href="shield.png">

      <p>If you are already carrying Weapons from <a href="../../lw/01fftd/title.htm">Book 1</a>, you can take this opportunity to exchange one or both of them.</p>
      <p>List the two items you choose on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points or <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>.</p>

      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time.</dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>

      </h4>
      <dl>
       <dt>Weapons</dt>
       <dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
       <dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry eight items in your Backpack at once.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Special Items</dt>
       <dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as the adventure progresses.<br/>
        <br/>Enter on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> a <a href="map.htm">map</a> that you found in the ashes of the Monastery.<br/>
        <br/>You begin this section with the Seal of Hammerdal, a ring that you wear on your right hand. Enter it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> under Special Items.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
       <dd>The local currency is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Gold Crowns can be used on your adventure to pay for transport, food, or even as a bribe! Many of the creatures that you will encounter possess Gold Crowns, or have them hidden in their lairs. Whenever you kill a creature, you may take any Gold Crowns that it has and put them in your Belt Pouch.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Food</dt>
       <dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your five skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.<br/>
        <br/>
       </dd>
       <dt>Healing Potion</dt>
       <dd>This can restore 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points immediately prior to a combat. There is only enough for one dose. If you discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be told then of their effect. All Healing Potions are Backpack Items.<br/>
