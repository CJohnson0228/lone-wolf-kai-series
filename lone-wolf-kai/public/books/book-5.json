      "text": "For twenty-five days, the Vassagonian galley sails on a steady course for its home port of Barrakeesh, with only a brief stop at the Durenese harbour of Port Bax to break a safe but monotonous voyage.\n\nYou use your time aboard the ship to good purpose, learning the Vassagonian language from the ship’s crew. They are only too eager to teach you, asking only in return tales of your adventures in the Lastlands—for many of the sailors, these are the most exciting stories they have ever heard. By the time you reach Barrakeesh, you have both mastered their language and won their respect.\n\nIt is early afternoon when the ramparts of the desert capital are first sighted on the horizon. You push your way through the cheering crew, and join the envoy at the prow of the ship. Beaming with pride, he hands you a telescope and invites you to view the land of his birth. The sight is indeed breathtaking. You stare in fascination at the golden domes, minarets, and green-tiled roofs shimmering beneath the desert sun, and marvel at the splendour of the Grand Palace, which dominates this magnificent city. Then you notice that from every golden turret of the palace flutters a long, black pennant. You ask the envoy of the meaning of the black flags. Horror floods across his face as he snatches the telescope from your hands. ‘By the spirit of the Majhan! He is dead … The Zakhan is dead!’\n\nAs the bad news spreads through the ship, you pray that the peace treaty will be signed and honoured by the Zakhan’s successor. However, the envoy is less than hopeful.\n\nThe harbour of Barrakeesh is deserted save for a handful of citizens clad in black, and the only sound that greets you is the toll of a funeral bell, echoing through the harbour on this day of mourning. Then a horse-drawn carriage enters the harbour square, escorted by the cavalry of the Palace Guard. It halts, and a dour man in turquoise robes steps out to meet you.\n\n‘A thousand greetings, Lone Wolf, I am Maouk, and I welcome you to our city on behalf of my master, his most sublime magnificence, Zakhan Kimah.’\n\nThe envoy gasps upon hearing the name of the new Zakhan. He turns to speak, his eyes wild with fear. ‘It is a trap, you must … ’\n\nHis warning is cut short by the blade of Maouk’s dagger. Suddenly, scores of black-clad warriors emerge from the shadows; they are Sharnazim, élite Vassagonian bodyguards. They close in, surrounding you on every side. You must act quickly if you are to survive this deadly trap.",

The Zakhan awaits his prize.’\n\nYou struggle to free yourself from the wire that cuts into your wrists, but Maouk is quick to see the danger. He grabs your arm and forces a dart into your skin. As sleep numbs all your senses, the last sound you hear is Maouk’s wicked laughter.",

If you wish to take either, or both, of these items, mark the Prism as a Backpack Item and the Copper Key as a Special Item (which you carry in your pocket) on yourAction Chart.\n\nThere is no exit from the library other than the marble door by which you entered.

You must get the Oede herb, even though it means you will have to enter the very place you are most anxious to avoid—the Grand Palace.\n\nThe alley follows a tortuous route through theMikarum, finally leading you to the‘Horm-tas-Lallaim’: the Tomb of the Princesses. Beyond the tomb, the Grand Palace rises like a massive white pantheon.\n\nYou suddenly recall a legend told to you by your Kai masters long ago: ‘The Nemesis of the Black Zakhan’. The Black Zakhan was a brutal tyrant, the cruellest of an evil lineage that ruled over the desert empire long ago. The barbaric excesses of his reign have never been forgotten in the Lastlands. The Grand Palace was built by his army of slaves, prisoners from countries he had conquered in war. The palace became his obsession; he personally oversaw its entire construction and punished the workers personally if there was the slightest delay. He butchered his subjects indiscriminately and in the most terrible fashion. His favourite form of execution was for the victim to be sawn in half from head to foot until the body fell in two pieces. However, it was the mass execution of the slaves who built the Grand Palace that made him infamous. He slaughtered every slave worker so that his enemies could never learn of the secret treasure chambers he had had constructed. Among the slaves were his only daughters, Kebilla and Sousse, who openly opposed their father’s cruelty and tried to prevent the executions. In a blind rage, he ordered that they should be the first to die.\n\nIt would have been better for the Zakhan, and for Vassagonia, if he himself had died that day. He lived for another two years, but his mind was unhinged by guilt, and he was tortured by self-loathing and despair. In the Grand Palace, the silence of the night was frequently broken by the Zakhan’s moans and cries, as he wandered from room to room looking for his daughters. When he died, he was laid beside them, here, in the Tomb of the Princesses.\n\nFrom where you stand, you can see two entrances to the Grand Palace; a spike-topped gate in the north wall, and an arch in the west wall, blocked by an iron portcullis. The palace is usually heavily guarded, but there are very few guards today; most are searching for you in the city.",

      "text": "Upon a raised platform, carpeted with scarlet fur, sits the Vassagonian Emperor, Zakhan Kimah. He is robed in gold but devoid of all ornamentation. In his hand is an orb of black metal, and in his eye an ice-cold cruelty that chills your spine. The Zakhan is a man of awesome countenance, but he pales in the shadow of his companion.\n\nBefore him stands the cause of your terror. A helm as black as death itself hides the face, but the stench of decay and a hideous sepulchral voice betray the identity.\n\n‘Give me Lone Wolf!’\n\nIt is the fell voice of a mortal enemy—a Darklord of Helgedad. As the Zakhan rises to his feet, you notice a flicker of doubt, or perhaps of fear, dim his cruel gaze, but he is quick to mask it. ‘He will be brought to you at sunset in exchange for the Orb of Death. It is agreed.’\n\n‘You have the Orb,’ echoes the chilling voice. ‘Give me Lone Wolf!’\n\nThe Zakhan hides his fear well, but time is not on his side. The game of bluff he is playing is deadly. However, the fact that he has not yet been discovered is evidence of his powerful will, for you sense the Darklord is persistently clawing and probing at his mind.\n\n‘You will get your Northlander, Lord Haakon,’ says the Zakhan, his voice curt with anger, ‘when you tell me why your servants defile the Tomb of the Majhan. You claim to have no need for gold and jewels—why then do you plunder the graves of our ancestors?’\n\nA deathly quiet fills the hall; only the unnatural hiss of the Darklord’s breath disturbs the silence. ‘This land, this insignificant speck of sand, harbours two small thorns that prick our skin. We seek to remove them both—forever. The fledgling Kai, Lone Wolf, is the thorn that denies us Sommerlund. The Tomb of the Majhan hides the other thorn that threatens us—the accursedBook of the Magnakai.’\n\nYour heart pounds as the words echo in your head. TheBook of the Magnakai! Suddenly, the reason why you have been enticed into a deadly trap becomes clear, and the sinister truth is revealed.\n\nTheBook of the Magnakaiis one of the oldest legends of Sommerlund. With the wisdom of the Magnakai, Sun Eagle, the first Kai Grand Master, instilled the disciplines into the warriors of the House of Ulnar, the bloodline of your king, that were to save your land from devastation at the hands of the Darklords. TheBook of the Magnakaiwas lost hundreds of years ago, but its wisdom was kept alive, handed down through generations of Sommlending warriors so that they could share the strength to resist their eternal enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.\n\nIf the Darklords discover and destroy theBook of the Magnakai, the secrets will be lost forever, and when you die, the Kai will become extinct. However, if you discover theBook of the Magnakaifirst and deny the Darklords their prize, all the wisdom of the Magnakai will be revealed to you. Through its wisdom you will become strong, strong enough to reach the ultimate achievement for a Sommlending warrior—to become a Kai Grand Master.\n\nHowever, the peril and the glory of the quest that lies ahead are distracting you from more immediate danger. To discover this danger and to begin the quest for theBook of the Magnakai, turn to Part Two ofShadow on the Sand.",

You are about to knock again when the door opens a few inches and the red-rimmed eyes of an old woman stare out from the darkness. ‘Banedon!’ she exclaims, her voice hoarse and shaky. ‘Thank the gods it is you.’\n\nShe ushers you both inside and locks the door. The house is sparsely furnished, and what little is there is either damaged or broken. ‘They have taken him, Banedon, they have taken my husband—the men with the faces of the dead. Ten days ago. They came like shadows in the night.’\n\nShe breaks down, her frail body wracked by sobs. Banedon comforts her as best he can, but you sense he shares her bitter loss. The Drakkarim have taken Tipasa, of that there is little doubt. By now they will have made him tell everything he knows about the Tomb of the Majhan.\n\n‘We will find him, I promise,’ says Banedon, wiping the tears from the old woman’s face, ‘but you must try to help us if you can. Tipasa always kept a diary of his travels—do you have it still?’\n\nA flicker of hope shines in the old woman’s eyes. ‘Yes, it is here. He told me to hide it when the evil men came for him.’\n\nShe kneels at an empty fireplace and prises a loose brick from the chimney; a leather-bound book drops from its hiding place into her hand. She gives it to Banedon who studies the yellowed pages, his face lined in thought. You notice that the book is full of cryptic symbols, numbers, and pictograms.\n\n‘They are drawn by the night stars,’ says Banedon, tracing his finger along the astronomical drawings. ‘They hold the secret, I know, but without my star charts we cannot hope to find the tomb. We must return to theSkyriderat first light. There I shall be able to make some sense of this book.’",

Instinctively you dodge aside at the very second it leaps. It crashes muzzle first into a marble pillar. A howl of pain leaves its broken mouth as you step forward and strike a death-blow; it will never attack again.\n\nYou glimpse the grim silhouette of Darklord Haakon in the hall below, his spiked fist raised. A Drakkar appears as if from nowhere and advances, a sword held high above his skull-like helm. There is a deafening crack as a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklord’s hand and comes hurtling towards you. The Drakkar lunges and wounds your arm (you lose 2ENDURANCEpoints), but he now stands in the path of the bolt. In a flash of light, the Drakkar is gone, leaving only cinders and the rotten odour of scorched flesh behind.\n\nAt the end of the balcony are another arch and a staircase.",

Once the traps had been sprung, the squashed bodies were cleared away and the slabs chiselled through to the next section. Pit traps in the floors seem to have been neutralized in the same way.

There is a broad avenue where a bridge of gnarled old wood and metal curves over the street, and here, beneath the wooden arch, you lie in wait for your prey.\n\nYour chance soon arrives; a black-robed rider enters the avenue and spurs his horse along the street.

You force open eyelids clogged with dried sweat, and look with dread at your wretched surroundings. You are lying on the hard stone floor of a prison cell. Over by the far wall, beneath a window criss-crossed with iron bars, is a low wooden bunk covered in filthy rags. Cockroaches, some the size of field mice, scuttle along a foul-smelling gutter that disappears into a grating in the floor. (Erase from yourAction Chartall Weapons, Special Items, Gold Crowns, and your Backpack and all its contents, but note them down elsewhere in case you should find them again later.)\n\nYou discover that your hands are free and slowly pull yourself upright into a sitting position, resting your back against the cell door. A faint draught from the corridor outside provides the only relief from the stifling heat and bad air of the cell. In the distance you can hear footsteps approaching. Then there is a jangle of keys and the creak of hinges. A door closes with a dull thud. More footsteps; they are getting louder. They come to halt outside the cell door and a loud voice bellows out: ‘Sleeping on duty, Sefrou? You’ll wake up on the other side of this door if the captain catches you!’\n\nThe chair scrapes along the ground, and a startled voice, full of indignation, replies: ‘Curse you, Hadj! The Zakhan doesn’t want the Northlander taken to the Grand Hall until sunset. You’ve cheated me of two hours sleep.’\n\n‘Shut up, Sefrou,’ snarls the first voice, ‘and listen hard. I’ve just come from the armoury. Some interesting trinkets were found on the Northlander, worth a great deal of gold I’d say. Seems a pity to let them go to waste, eh?’\n\nThe two guards chuckle greedily and discuss at length the good time they will be able to have in the city, once they have sold your equipment.\n\n‘I’ll take a peek at our friend,’ says one of the guards. ‘I wonder if he’s enjoying our hospitality.’\n\nA spy-hole slides open above your head and you hear a gasp of shock. ‘He’s gone! He’s gone! By the Majhan, we’ll lose our heads!’ You suddenly realize that you cannot be seen so close to the door.\n\n‘Let me see,’ hisses the other guard, eager to see for himself.
